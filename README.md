The puzzle is a square shape of nine squares (that is, 3 Ã— 3 squares high), and each square is subdivided into a nine-square grid. In each small nine-square grid, fill in the numbers from 1 to 9, so that the numbers in each column and each row of the entire large nine-square grid are not repeated. The gameplay logic of Sudoku is simple, and the arrangement of numbers is ever-changing.
